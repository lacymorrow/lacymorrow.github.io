Every quest needs a hero.
-------------------------

The avatar you create on Hackpack will represent you throughout the conference. You can equip your avatar directly on your Hackpack, or log into [TwilioQuest](http://twilio.com/quest) to create it there.

Interact with the environment.
------------------------------

Hackpack knows how to talk to the environment at SIGNAL. From controlling large-scale games with the joystick, to seeing your avatar on the big screen, you'll want to keep your Hackpack with you.

A platform for hacking
----------------------

A web browser that knows tricks
-------------------------------

Hackpack boots into a special SIGNAL interface we made to guide you through the conference. But you don't need to stay in our walled garden; you can send it to any URL. Your web app has full access to the joystick, game buttons, and LED bar.

Blinking lights
---------------

Hackpack wouldn't be complete without lights that blink. This year we added five.

A badge that runs Linux
-----------------------

It's a fully-integrated Raspberry Pi, gamepad, with a screen. And a DEF CON® SAO header for whatever reason.

Plays nice with others
----------------------

Hackpack v4 is part of a much bigger family of hackable oddities.

Defcon Sh*tty Add-Ons Compatible
--------------------------------

Hackpack is compatible with the [Defcon Sh*tty Add-Ons](https://hackaday.io/project/52950-shitty-add-ons) protocol by way of the innocuous pinset in the top right corner of Hackpack. Add [delightful](https://www.tindie.com/products/LithoChasm/corgi-butt-sao-badgelife-addon/), [weird](https://www.tindie.com/products/twinkletwinkie/twinkletwinkies-badgelife-sao-add-on-6/) attachments to Hackpack.

Serial port on-board
--------------------

In the realm of the less esoteric, Hackpacks include a white Seeed Grove connector with 3.3v serial signals broken out.
