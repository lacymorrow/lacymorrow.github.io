A collection of finished and unfinished games and utilities written in BASIC for the TI-83/84/+. Completed apps:

**[Drawout](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/398/39855.html)**: A drawing application with a few features and enhancements.

**[Jackpot](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/397/39764.html)**: A casino-style slot machine, using characters rather than images.

**[Jumper](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/397/39765.html)**: My personal favorite, a simple jumper. Press the button, jump over the whole.

**[Matches](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/398/39857.html)**: Also called Nim, a classic two-player puzzle game. Play a friend or the computer. Force your opponent to take the last match.
