# Cinematic Desktop Movie UI

Cinematic is a desktop movie UI built with React and Electron.

I wanted a way to organize and get information on my huge digital movie collection. Cinematic finds the movie plot, summary, and details for every file, including torrent files with weird names. Poster art and trailers are also available. I've open sourced a number of NPM libraries that I built for this project to fetch movie art, info, and trailers.
