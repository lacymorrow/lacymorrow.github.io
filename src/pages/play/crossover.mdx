# CrossOver: Crosshair Overlay

CrossOver is a simple crosshair overlay for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It's a relatively small Electron app that supports a plethora of different features and settings.

## Lucky me

My app was ripped off! I found CrossOver on the Windows store, ripped off and repackaged. Somewhat of an accomplishment.
