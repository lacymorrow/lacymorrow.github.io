# Giga Jukebox

The Giga Jukebox was created to be a radically feature-filled web music player for budding artists and labels alike. Features buying or saving in multiple file formats, album art, personal playlist features (save/add/remove), drag–n–drop rearranging, and a powerful Javascript API for full integration. Sadly, the budget was cut and the project was never finished. It’s now available here with the full source.
