# Interactive User Interface

In the early 2000's, I was hired to create some novel user interaction designs for a website (this was before such a thing as a "web application"). Being old and outdated, many features are now broken but the idea and uniqueness remains. Click and drag a topic to the screen and play around!

The original supported music, video, news, and photos.<br />It was a fullscreen experience, so the demo below is a bit cramped.

  Some of the APIs used in this demo are no longer available, so some features are broken.
