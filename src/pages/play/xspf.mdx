# XSPF Jukebox

## About

Originally "XSPF Web Media Player" by Fabricio Zuardi, XSPF Jukebox is a web-based music player for `.xspf` playlists, written in ActionScript 2.0.

At one point it was one of the most popular media players on the web, and was used by sites like [Last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) and [Hype Machine](https://www.hypem.com/).

It was originally written in 2004 and has been updated to work with modern browsers.
