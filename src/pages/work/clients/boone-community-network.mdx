> Facebook-like social network for the town of Boone, NC

The Boone Community Network was a project I worked on with a few friends in 2013. The goal was to create a social network for the town of Boone, NC. The idea was that it would be a place for people to share events, classifieds, and other information about the town. It was also a place for local businesses to advertise their services.
