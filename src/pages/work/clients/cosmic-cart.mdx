## About

> Created custom email notification system, authentication system, splash page for product launch; Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP

Cosmic Cart was a startup that aimed to make it easy for anyone to sell products online. I was an initial co-founder, brought on to help build the initial product and launch the website. I created a custom email notification system, authentication system, and splash page for the product launch. I also helped with the Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP server setup.

The founder went on to raise a seed round of funding and was [featured on TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/startup-battlefield/company/cosmic-cart/) before the company was acquired by PopSugar in 2013.
