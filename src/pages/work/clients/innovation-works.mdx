## About

> Custom WordPress theme inspired by The Harvard Review

Home for Innovation is a non-profit organization that helps people with disabilities live independently. They needed a website that would allow them to easily update their content and add new pages. I created a custom WordPress theme for them that allows them to do just that. The site is responsive and looks great on mobile devices.
