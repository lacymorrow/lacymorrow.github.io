# Flymore Drone Academy

In 2017, my brother, my cousin and I started a drone academy. We teach young people how to build, tune, and fly their own drones and how to get their drone license.

It culminated in a week-long camp that saw 24 kids build their own drones and fly them. We finished the week with our own FPV drone racing competition.
